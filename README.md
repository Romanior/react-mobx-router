### React Create App with React Router and MobX

This project is a personal boilerplate as a quickstart for development with [react-create-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) + [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) and [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) to maintain the state of the App.

This boilerplate implements [custom-react-scripts](https://github.com/kitze/custom-react-scripts) to be able to implement @decorators and CSS Modules for Sass/Less/Stylus implementations.

I'm not interested in creating an opinionated boilerplate with strict rules about how to do stuff. The beauty of Javascript is that, you can do it as you want, the way you feel more confortable with so, **you should** modify the project structure as you want while it's easier for you to work with, also changing any other aspect of the execution.

Hope you find this useful.

Enjoy!
